# Subtask 3: Network Visualization

This folder contains all of our Gephi visualizations that were generated for this project. They are organized into two folders:

- **Final Graphs**: 
  - This has the main Gephi visualization of our weighted, undirected graph, along with its corresponding color legend.
  - The folder also contains the co-occurrence graph generated from our bipartite network.
- **Sub-Visualizations**: 
  - This contains all of the filters and sub-visualizations used to address the research questions. 
  - Some of these include:
    - Renowned vs. Un-renowned
    - Male vs. Female
    - Top 10 vs Bottom 10 Average Director Homogeneity Scores
